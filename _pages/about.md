Skills and Interests
------
I began studying GIS in the summer of 2023. I've had ample experience with ArcOnline and ArcGIS Pro. I am still getting acclimated with QGIS and RStudio. 
Environmental science hs always been a passion of mine. I got my first field experience delineating wetlands with Ken Scarlatelli throughout the summer of 2021. UMBC courses such as Geomorphology, Aquatic Ecology, and Applications of GIS have helped expand my horizons of what is possible through field work and data science.
